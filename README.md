# Pictures Website
This is a website I created in PHP years ago. The project was designed to display and search for photos. It looks a bit dated, but it protects against SQL injection!

The website was created using a LAMP stack. I no longer own the machine, but the code could be used to inform other websites.

I am no longer learning PHP and have switched to JavaScript.
